Want faster page loads? Use a CDN!

It's also worth noting that because so many websites use jQuery, there's a very good chance that your users' browsers have already cached the same copy of jQuery that you want to use.

If you use a CDN, your users' browsers will recognize that they already have a cached copy of jQuery from the same CDN when your site loads, which means that they don't need to download it again. So those extra KBs from jquery.min.js won't be downloaded and your site will load faster!


---------------==============================-----------------------

A function passed into the jQuery object runs on document.ready, which occurs after the DOM has been loaded.
Why is this useful?

External JavaScript files in the <head> of a document are generally downloaded earlier than JavaScript files included in the <body>. JavaScript files are also executed immediately at their location in the document, which means they can't access any DOM elements that come after their <script> tag in the DOM. This leads to some interesting situations.

Imagine you're building a website and you've got a script you want to run against some DOM elements in the page. If you include your script in the <head> normally, it will run as soon as it's downloaded, which will occur before the DOM has built the elements you want your script to run against. So your script wouldn't be able to do anything.

You could include your script at the bottom of the <body>, but that would mean that the download could potentially start later in the load process, slowing down the initial page render.

So what can you do?

Pass your function into the jQuery object, like so:

function someFunction() {
    // Do interesting things
}
$(someFunction)

or

$(function(){
    // Do interesting things
})

Now, you can include your script in the <head> and it won't run until the DOM has been built and the elements that you want to manipulate are on the page.

To try this technique out, I've included a zip file of a sample website in the Downloadables section. Click "Continue to Quiz" to try this technique for yourself!

You can download the jQuery-Sample-Site.zip here.

For this quiz, can you use the script that is linked in the of index.html, to change the boring placeholder image to a picture of a cute animal?

Remember, you'll need to pass a function into the jQuery object to run when the document is ready.

Good luck!
