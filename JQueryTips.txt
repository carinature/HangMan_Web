Want faster page loads? Use a CDN!

It's also worth noting that because so many websites use jQuery, there's a very good chance that your users' browsers have already cached the same copy of jQuery that you want to use.

If you use a CDN, your users' browsers will recognize that they already have a cached copy of jQuery from the same CDN when your site loads, which means that they don't need to download it again. So those extra KBs from jquery.min.js won't be downloaded and your site will load faster!
